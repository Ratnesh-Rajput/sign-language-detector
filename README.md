## Sign Language Detector using Python and OpenCV

This project is a Sign Language Detector implemented in Python using the OpenCV library. It detects and recognizes various sign language gestures captured through a webcam or video input.

### Features:

Real-time sign language gesture detection
Pre-trained models for recognizing common sign language gestures
Customizable for adding new gestures and training the model
Requirements:

Python 3.x
OpenCV library
NumPy library
Any necessary dependencies for your specific environment


### Installation:
1. Install Python: Download and install Python from the official website if you haven't already.

2. Install OpenCV: You can install OpenCV using pip, the Python package manager:

  * ``` pip install opencv-python```

3.Install NumPy:
*  ```pip install numpy```

### Usage:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the sign language detector script:
  *  ```python sign-language-detector.py```
4. Point your webcam towards your hand gestures.
5. The application will detect and recognize the sign language gestures in real-time.
Customization:

You can train the model with your own dataset by modifying the training script and providing your dataset.
